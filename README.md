## Item Catalog Project made by Ali Zahran


### Project Overview
-We will develop an application that provides a list of items within a variety of categories as well as provide a user registration and authentication system. Registered users will have the ability to post, edit and delete their own items.


### What Will we Learn?
-We will learn how to develop a RESTful web application using the Python framework Flask along with implementing third-party OAuth authentication. We will then learn when to properly use the various HTTP methods available to you and how these methods relate to CRUD (create, read, update and delete) operations.


### How Does This Help My Career?
*Efficiently interacting with data is the backbone upon which performant web applications are built
*Properly implementing authentication mechanisms and appropriately mapping HTTP methods to CRUD operations are core features of a properly secured web application
